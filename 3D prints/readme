3D print parts list:

2x modular camera mounts - 1 must be printed mirrored
     These should would for most nano and micro sized cameras
     Other mounts can be found in the “work in progress prints” folder
1x canopyPB
1x front link
1x rear link
1x spoiler fin
1x spoiler


Most prints can be done with minimal to no supports if printed in the intended orientation

the "canopyPB" and "spoiler" prints do not need to be printed at 100% infil but should be reasonably robust

If you have any requests for different camera mounts or to fix a print please

WARNING: there is no camera mount for the 25mm canopy files in this repository
