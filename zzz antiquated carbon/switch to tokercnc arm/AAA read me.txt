these arms are now considered antiquated as of 8/18/22.

we are switching to the toker CNC style arm to make the majority of Street League Spec arms on the market compatible with eachother.

The Toker arm and the Kauri arm are not directly cross compatible. you can make them compatible by filing a corner down on the Toker arm where it meets the inside corner of the Kauri arm. a photo of where these two parts conflict is provided in this folder.
